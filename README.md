# Home-price-prediction-project
This data science project demonstrates how to build a real estate price prediction website. We'll walk through the step-by-step process, covering various data science concepts and technologies. By the end of this project, you'll have a functional web application that predicts home prices based on input features.

## Project Overview

1. **Model Building**:
    - We'll start by creating a machine learning model using **scikit-learn** and linear regression.
    - The dataset we'll use is the **Bangalore home prices dataset** from Kaggle.
    - Our goal is to predict home prices based on features like square footage,bedroom,location and BHK.

2. **Python Flask Server**:
    - In the second step, we'll write a **Python Flask server**.
    - This server will use the trained model to serve HTTP requests.
    - It acts as the backend for our web application.

3. **Web Application**:
    - The third component is the **website** itself.
    - We'll build the frontend using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.
    - Users can input home square footage and bedroom count.
    - The website will call the Python Flask server to retrieve the predicted price.

## Data Science Concepts Covered

Throughout the project, we'll explore the following concepts:

- **Data Loading and Cleaning**:
    - We'll load the dataset and preprocess it using **NumPy** and **Pandas**.
    - Cleaning steps include handling missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.

- **Feature Engineering**:
    - We'll create relevant features from the existing data.
    - Feature engineering enhances model performance.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
    - We'll use **GridSearchCV** to find optimal hyperparameters for our model.

- **K-Fold Cross Validation**:
    - To assess model performance, we'll implement K-fold cross-validation.

## Technology Stack and Tools

- **Python**: Our primary programming language.
- **Numpy** and **Pandas**: For data cleaning and manipulation.
- **Matplotlib**: Used for data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn (sklearn)**: For building the machine learning model.
- **Jupyter Notebook**, **Visual Studio Code**, and **PyCharm**: Our IDEs.
- **Python Flask**: The backend server.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: For the user interface.

## Deployment

We're deploying our project using **Nginx** as the web server. Nginx will handle incoming requests and route them to our Python Flask server.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Set up your Python environment (preferably using a virtual environment).
3. Install the required packages (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
4. Run the Flask server (`python app.py`).
5. Open the website in your browser and start predicting home prices!
